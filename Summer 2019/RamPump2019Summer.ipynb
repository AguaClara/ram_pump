Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge.\n",

In these examples, many of the requirement below have already been met, so we recommend you understand and use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basics\n",
        " - Create the graph using Python and the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html) package.\n",
        "- Place a caption with a brief description below the graph. Add this caption using the wiki formatting, not in your graphing software.\n",
        "- Insert the graph in your report after the first paragraph with a reference to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Appearance\n",
        "- Use a white background.\n",
        "- Use the same font in the graphs as you use in the text of the report.\n",
        "- Scale the size of the graph so it is large enough to see the data and read the text without having to follow a link to see a larger image. Avoid using hyperlinks on images, because an export to Microsoft Word will not include the image.\n",
        "\n",
        " Axes\n",
        " - Data with x and y values should be presented using an xy scatter plot.\n",
        " - Label all axes and include units.\n",
        " - Axis scale labels should be in the margin of the graph, not inside the graph border.\n",
        " - If the x-axis is time, then make time zero the beginning of the test.\n",
        " - Eliminate ranges of the x and y axes that are not used or meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Representation\n",
        " - Use data symbols, not a line, to show discrete data points.\n",
        " - However, if there is so much data that the symbols overlap, it is better to connect the data points with a line and not show the data symbols.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple Plots\n",
        " - When presenting multiple plots on a single graph make sure that it is easy to distinguish the plots using the legend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Curve Fitting\n",
        " - If curve fitting is used, explain why and include the equation elsewhere in the report.\n",
        " - The model or theoretical curve should be a smooth curve without data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a graph created by example code in the [Data Analysis&#46;md](https://github.com/AguaClara/team_resources/blob/master/Example%20Code/Data%20Analysis.md) document referenced in the beginning of this section. **Note that the code is included and linked at the bottom of this report.
